                        Better understand your weight in relation to your height
                        using our body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is
                        not the sole determinant of a healthy weight, it offers
                        a valuable starting point to evaluate your overall
                        health and well-being.

                    <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
                    <p>
                        A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy
                        weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your
                        chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as
                        obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet
                        with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample
                        fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular
                        physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
                        five days a week.

                        <p>
                            Healthy eating promotes weight control, disease
                            prevention, better digestion, immunity, mental
                            clarity, and mood.

                        <p>
                            Exercise improves fitness, aids weight control,
                            elevates mood, and reduces disease risk, fostering
                            wellness and longevity.

                        <h3>Adequate sleep</h3>
                        <p>
                            Sleep enhances mental clarity, emotional stability,
                            and physical wellness, promoting overall restoration
                            and rejuvenation.

                <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
                <p>
                    Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy
                    weight, it is not suited for every person. Specific groups
                    should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain
                    cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.

                            alt="gender icon"
                        />
                        <h3>Gender</h3>
                        <p>
                            The development and body fat composition of girls
                            and boys vary with age. Consequently, a child's age
                            and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.

                        <h3>Age</h3>
                        <p>
                            In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle
                            loss may cause BMI to underestimate body fat
                            content.

                        <h3>Muscle</h3>
                        <p>
                            BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as
                            overweight or obese, as it doesn't differentiate
                            muscle from fat.

                        <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
                        <p>
                            Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to
                            their growing baby. Maintaining a healthy
                            pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health
                            risks for both mother and child.

                            others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this
                            with your GP or practice nurse.
