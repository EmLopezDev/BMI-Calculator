                        obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet
                        with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample
                        fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular
                        physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
                        five days a week.
